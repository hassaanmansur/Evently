# 🎉 Evently – Discover Events Near You

This is a simple and clean React-based web app that lets you browse local events happening around you. I’ve added some cool sample events from Pakistan 🇵🇰 to give it a more relatable vibe.

You can search for events by name, check out the details, and pretend to register 😄 (the button doesn’t actually do anything yet).

## 🛠️ What I Used

- **React** – for building the UI
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – for logic and interactivity
- **CSS3** – for custom styling and layout
- **Vercel** – to deploy the site live
